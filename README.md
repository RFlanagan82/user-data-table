# User Data Table

Deployed site: https://judeclark19.github.io/user-data-table

![Our Cohort table screenshot](./data-table-ss.png)

This table built using react and [react-table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) shows the contact info of myself and my classmates from GA Tech's full stack coding Bootcamp in October 2020. Click on any column header to sort the table by that column. Type anything in the search input to filter the table.
